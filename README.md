# MLEnd-Yummy-Dataset-Image-Classification

The mini-project has two separate components:

1. Basic component: Using the MLEnd Yummy Dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input a photo of a dish that has either rice or chips and predicts whether the picture has rice or chips.
2. Advanced component: Using the MLEnd Yummy Dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input a photo of a dish that predicts whether the photo is a vegetarian food or non-vegetarian food.

Result finding: Texture feature is more relevant than colour feature for advanced component.
